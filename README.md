# ðŸ§ª Computer Vision â€“ Effective Tasks

This branch contains a practical collection of image processing tasks implemented in Python using OpenCV and NumPy. These notebooks go beyond basic operations and provide hands-on experience with various techniques, transformations, and GUI-based image manipulation.

## ðŸ“‚ Notebook Overview

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_Image_Arithmetic_Operations.ipynb` | Perform arithmetic operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide on images |
| `02_Bitplane_GrayLevel_HistogramEqualization.ipynb` | Bitplane slicing, intensity adjustment, and histogram equalization |
| `03_Convolution_and_Histogram.ipynb` | Apply convolution filters and visualize image histograms |
| `04_Image_Transforms_and_Negation.ipynb` | Log and power-law transformations, image negation, and distance formulas |
| `05_Image_Histogram.ipynb` | Generate and interpret image histograms |
| `06_Combined_Image_Processing_Tasks.ipynb` | Mixed image processing tasks and testing operations |
| `07_Image_Thresholding.ipynb` | Apply binary, adaptive, and inverse thresholding methods |
| `08_Menu_Based_Operations_and_Bitwise.ipynb` | Menu-based GUI for add, sub, slicing, masking, and bitwise operations |
