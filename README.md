# 🧠 Computer Vision Repository – Master Branch

Welcome to the **Computer Vision Task Repository**, a centralized hub of structured assignments and effective practical tasks in computer vision using OpenCV and Python.

---

## 🌿 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two primary branches:

---

### 📘 `assignment`

This branch contains core computer vision assignments designed to help develop a strong foundation in basic image processing.

**Key Tasks Include:**
- Image loading and display
- Thresholding
- Image arithmetic
- Histogram equalization
- Morphological operations
- Edge detection
- Contour detection

### 🧪 `effective-task`

This branch includes more applied and practical notebooks with real-world usage of CV techniques. Some notebooks include GUI-based image editing and combined operations.

**Key Tasks Include:**
- Bitplane slicing
- Image transformations (log, power)
- Histogram processing
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Menu-based CV tools using OpenCV
